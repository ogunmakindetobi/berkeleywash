Testing by friends and family
I asked some of my friends and family members to test my project. So would get some idea's of what i needed tot fix or they would see something I didn't even think about.

* Test user 1:

1.  The text of the "navbar" section is a bit too long, and it conflicts with the simple feel the rest of the website tries to give. Solution: I reduce the margin the "Navbar" so its fit in when view on smaller screen.
